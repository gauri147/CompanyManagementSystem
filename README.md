# CompanyManagementSystem
Create the following tables from the COMPANY database: EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, WORKS_ON, DEPT_LOCATIONS, DEPENDENT (these correspond to 3.7 (6th edition) or 5.7 (7th edition) of the textbook) using SQLPLUS. Write your CREATE TABLE statements in a text file and execute the commands from the file through SQLPLUS.
You should capture the execution in a spool file that will be turned in. Specify appropriate key and referential integrity constraints. Choose appropriate data types for each attribute. 
Write one or more database programs to load the records that will be provided to you into each of the tables that you created.
